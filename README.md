# Django registration with confirmation email and two factor authentication using the google authenticator app 

This is a django application created using Django 1.10 and python 3.6. The project has 
extended django authentication and I have implemented the ability for user to register, 
after a given user register in our web app, we send an email for user
to click a link and confirm they control the email used during registration. The project has 
also implemented the ability to enable two factor authentication using [Google Authenticator App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en)
